# Advance-Medical-Plant-analysis-by-Integrating-web-GIS
## Introudction
The objective of the project is to develop a cutting-edge system of analysis and identification of medicinal plants through an integrated Geographic Information System technology, web, and mobile platforms. The interface of the medicinal plants' historic data access and analysis, offered on the web application, is detailed, showing how the plants would have grown, their distribution pattern, and uses over some time. On the other hand, the Android mobile application serves as an on-site data collection powerhouse, allowing users to capture pictures of plants alongside geolocation and habitat details. A Python-based machine learning model was then developed using TensorFlow, which was trained on a comprehensive dataset of images of medicinal plants, together with their labels. The model is supported by a mobile application whereby a user can capture an image through the mobile app, and this model analyzes the image to identify the species of plants, thereby providing real-time feedback to the user. This integrated approach will not only allow real-time identification of medicinal plants but also enrich the dataset that botanical research uses to better understand plant biodiversity. It will show the location where we took the picture for understanding the surrounding where the plants came and analyze it. It contributes to the betterment of botanical research in medicinal plants and helps in ensuring that their use is based on sustainable practices
